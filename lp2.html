    const lifePath2 = `The Moon's Favourite!! People with Life Path 2 are like the Wi-Fi in a coffee shop—always connecting everyone, keeping the peace, and making sure things run smoothly, even when no one notices. Sure, sometimes you might feel like you're stuck in "buffering" mode, trying to keep everyone happy, but that's just because you're a natural diplomat. You’ve got the emotional intelligence of a therapist, the patience of someone waiting for the next season of their favorite show, and the ability to smooth over drama faster than you can say, “It’s fine.” And don’t forget—your sensitivity and kindness are like superpowers! While the world may feel chaotic, you’re the calm in the storm, quietly reminding everyone how awesome it is to have someone like you around. Keep being your wonderful, harmonious self!
    You are quite literally the queen of your life, lucky you! You are also a gifted manifestor, so try to keep the negative thoughts at bay. You're the most compatible with life path numbers 1,5, 3 and 7! Worst match would prolly (YES, PROBABLY), be Life Path Number 8.`;
